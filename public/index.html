        <h1 id="Nets-Drop-2nd-Straight-To-Struggling-Mets"><a href="#Nets-Drop-2nd-Straight-To-Struggling-Mets" class="headerlink" title="Nets Drop 2nd Straight To Struggling Mets"></a>Nets Drop 2nd Straight To Struggling Mets</h1><p>The Brooklyn Nets were hoping for a different result in their second matchup against the New York Mets, but they once again lost by a score of 111-95.</p>
<p>This time around, it was the Mets who had the hot hand, shooting 50 percent from the field and 45 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, the Nets shot just 41 percent overall and made only six three-pointers.</p>
<p>Brooklyn’s defense was also gashed by the Mets, who racked up 63 points in the paint. Meanwhile, the Nets could only muster 36 points in the paint themselves.</p>
<p>Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson was clearly disappointed with his team’s performance:<br>“They just played better than us,” Atkinson said after the game. “They were more physical, they executed better.”</p>
<p>The Nets now find themselves with a 4-10 record on the season and will look to get back on track when they take on the Detroit Pistons later this week.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Won’t-The-Mets-Win-In-Their-Own-Stadium"><a href="#Why-Won’t-The-Mets-Win-In-Their-Own-Stadium" class="headerlink" title="Why Won’t The Mets Win In Their Own Stadium?"></a>Why Won’t The Mets Win In Their Own Stadium?</h1><p>The Mets have not had very much success at Citi Field. The Mets are a team that should be able to win in their own ballpark, but they have not been able to do that. Their home record is significantly worse than their road record.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that have contributed to this. One is the fact that the Mets’ bullpen has not been very good. The bullpen has blown a number of games at home, which has led to the Mets losing those games.</p>
<p>Another factor is the fact that the Mets have not been able to score many runs at home. This has been due in part to the fact that they have had trouble hitting home runs at home. They have only hit 23 homers at Citi Field this season, compared to 47 homers on the road.</p>
<p>The Mets have also had trouble with defense at home. They have made a number of costly errors, which has led to them losing games they should have won.</p>
<p>The Mets will need to address these issues if they hope to win more games at Citi Field. The good news is that there is still time for them to do so. They still have some time left in the season to improve their play at home and make a run for the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Conforto-Frazier-Homer-Again-As-Mets-Stay-Alive"><a href="#Conforto-Frazier-Homer-Again-As-Mets-Stay-Alive" class="headerlink" title="Conforto, Frazier Homer Again As Mets Stay Alive"></a>Conforto, Frazier Homer Again As Mets Stay Alive</h1><p>In a matchup that pitted young starters against one another in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, it was the Mets hitters who stole the show. Michael Conforto and Todd Frazier went yard off Gerrit Cole to give their team a 3-0 lead after three innings, and they would never look back, cruising to an 8-1 victory to stay alive in the series.</p>
<p>It was clear early on that the Mets were going to take advantage of Cole’s mistakes; both Conforto and Frazier were able to drive the ball out of the park after getting good pitches to hit. Frazier’s home run was especially timely, coming as it did after the Astros had scored their only run of the game in the top of the inning.</p>
<p>The rest of the Mets lineup also contributed, with eight different players recording at least one hit. Jay Bruce and Yoenis Cespedes each drove in two runs, and Austin Jackson added a triple to his postseason resume.</p>
<p>The win keeps the Mets’ season alive for at least one more day; they will now head to Houston for Game 5 with their backs against the wall. If they can manage to win that game, they will move on to face either the Dodgers or Braves in the NL Championship Series.</p>
<h1 id="5-Reasons-Why-Mets-Fans-Are-Disappointed-In-This-Season"><a href="#5-Reasons-Why-Mets-Fans-Are-Disappointed-In-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="5 Reasons Why Mets Fans Are Disappointed In This Season"></a>5 Reasons Why Mets Fans Are Disappointed In This Season</h1><p>The New York Mets are one of the most iconic franchises in all of sports. The team has a rich history, filled with both highs and lows. However, the past few seasons have been a disappointment for the Mets’ fans. This season is no different, as the Mets sit in last place in the National League East with a record of 36-48. So, what are the reasons why Mets fans are disappointed in this season?</p>
<ol>
<li>Injuries</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the main reasons for the Mets’ disappointing season is injuries. The team has been ravaged by injuries this season, with key players such as Matt Harvey, Lucas Duda, and Neil Walker missing significant time. This has led to inconsistency on the field, as the Mets have had trouble finding a consistent lineup.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Poor Play</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to injuries, the Mets have also been plagued by poor play this season. The team ranks near the bottom of the league in most offensive categories, and their pitching staff has been inconsistent as well. This has resulted in a number of blowout losses, which has left fans frustrated.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Lack of Star Power</li>
</ol>
<p>Another reason why fans are disappointed this season is because the Mets lack star power. Unlike teams such as the Yankees or Dodgers, who have several superstar players, the Mets don’t have any stand-out players. As a result, they often struggle to score runs and win games.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Disappointing Season After Season</li>
</ol>
<p>Fans are also disappointed because it seems like the Mets always have a disappointing season. They haven’t made playoffs since 2006 and they haven’t won a World Series since 1986. This year’s poor play simply adds to that frustration.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Negative Media Coverage</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, one of the main reasons why fans are disappointed this season is because of all the negative media coverage the team has received. From Sandy Alderson trade rumors to reports of infighting within the team, there has been plenty for fans to be concerned about this season.</p>
<h1 id="Can-The-Mets-Salvage-A-Postseason-Berth"><a href="#Can-The-Mets-Salvage-A-Postseason-Berth" class="headerlink" title="Can The Mets Salvage A Postseason Berth?"></a>Can The Mets Salvage A Postseason Berth?</h1><p>The Mets (69-61) have officially been eliminated from playoff contention, per Anthony DiComo of MLB.com.</p>
<p>This news is devastating to a team that entered the season with high hopes of winning their first NL pennant since 2000. The Mets were crippled by injuries early in the season and never recovered, despite assembling a talented roster led by Yoenis Cespedes, Jacob deGrom, and Noah Syndergaard.</p>
<p>So now that their playoff hopes are gone, what’s next for the Mets?</p>
<p>One option for the Mets is to trade some of their valuable assets before the August 31 waiver trade deadline. Cespedes, who is owed $29 million in 2018-2019, could be attractive to many teams looking for a power bat. deGrom and Syndergaard are also possible trade targets, as both are under team control for several more years.</p>
<p>If the Mets decide to stick with their current roster, they could still make a strong playoff run. The team is only 3 games back of the Milwaukee Brewers for the second wild card spot in the National League.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what direction the Mets choose to go in over the next few weeks. With an exciting young core and plenty of financial flexibility, they could go either way.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Pick-the-Best-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino"><a href="#How-to-Pick-the-Best-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How to Pick the Best Slot Machine in a Casino"></a>How to Pick the Best Slot Machine in a Casino</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games. They are easy to play and can be very lucrative. The key to winning at slot machines is picking the right machine. Here are some tips for choosing the best slot machine in a casino.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider when picking a slot machine is your bankroll. Make sure you choose a machine that you can afford to play. If you have a large bankroll, you may want to choose a higher denomination machine. If you have a smaller bankroll, choose a lower denomination machine.</p>
<p>The second thing to consider is the payout percentage of the machine. The higher the payout percentage, the better your chances of winning. However, keep in mind that machines with high payouts also tend to have higher stakes.</p>
<p>The third thing to consider is how often the machine pays out. The best machines are those that pay out frequently, but not too often. Look for machines that have payouts of around 96% or higher.</p>
<p>Finally, always consult the payout schedule before playing any slot machine. This will tell you how much each symbol pays out and how many coins you need to win the jackpot.</p>
<h1 id="3-Tips-for-Choosing-the-Best-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino"><a href="#3-Tips-for-Choosing-the-Best-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="3 Tips for Choosing the Best Slot Machine in a Casino"></a>3 Tips for Choosing the Best Slot Machine in a Casino</h1><p>When you walk into a casino, you will likely see rows and rows of slot machines. With so many options to choose from, how do you know which one is the best for you? Here are three tips to help you make the best decision.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Decide What Type of Player You Are</p>
<p>The first step in choosing a slot machine is to decide what type of player you are. If you like to play fast and furious, then you will want a machine with higher volatility. This means that it offers bigger wins but also comes with more risk. If you would rather play at a slower pace and enjoy more consistent wins, then go for a machine with lower volatility.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Look for High Payouts </p>
<p>When comparing different slots machines, be sure to look at the payout percentage. This tells you how much money the machine pays out on average relative to the amount that players put in. The higher the payout percentage, the better your chances of winning money.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Consider Your Budget </p>
<p>Another factor to consider when choosing a slot machine is your budget. If you have a limited amount of money to spend, then look for machines that have lower bet limits. This will help ensure that you don’t run out of money before you have a chance to win big.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Choose-the-Right-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Right-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Right Slot Machine in a Casino"></a>How to Choose the Right Slot Machine in a Casino</h1><p>You may be new to casinos, or you may just be unsure of which machine to play when you hit the casino floor. That’s why we’re here to help. This guide will teach you how to choose the right slot machine in a casino, so you can maximize your chances of winning and have a fun time doing it.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is find a bank of machines that appeal to you. You’ll want to find games with themes that you enjoy, or with bonus rounds that intrigue you. Once you’ve found a few games that look fun, it’s time to learn about the payout rates.</p>
<p>Every game will have a payout rate listed on the front of the machine. This percentage tells you how often the machine pays out winners. You’ll want to find a game with a payout rate above 95%, as anything lower than that means the house has an edge over players.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a game with a high payout rate, it’s time to start playing. But don’t start betting big money right away! Remember, even the best slot machine still has odds against players, so make sure to gamble responsibly. Start by betting smaller amounts and increase your bets as your wins increase. This way, you can walk away from the machine with some extra cash in your pocket, regardless of whether or not you hit the jackpot.</p>
<h1 id="5-Tips-for-Picking-the-Perfect-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Picking-the-Perfect-Slot-Machine-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Picking the Perfect Slot Machine in a Casino"></a>5 Tips for Picking the Perfect Slot Machine in a Casino</h1><p>Whether you are a first-time casino visitor or an experienced gambler, the decision of which slot machine to play can be daunting. With row after row of brightly lit machines beckoning you to try your luck, how do you know which one is right for you? Here are five tips for picking the perfect slot machine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide how much money you want to spend.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you even step foot in the casino, it’s important to have a budget in mind. Slot machines can be addictive and before you know it, you may have blown through your bankroll without even scratching the surface of what’s available. Decide how much money you are comfortable spending and stick to that number.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do your research.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all slot machines are created equal. Some offer higher payouts than others, so it’s important to do your research before deciding on a machine. Casinos often have charts posted near their slots listing the payout percentages for each machine. Choose one with a high payout percentage to increase your chances of winning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stick to simple slots if this is your first time gambling.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re new to casino gambling, it might be best to stick to simple slots until you get the hang of things. These machines usually have fewer paylines and simpler bonus rounds, making them easier to understand and increasing your chances of winning something.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Play the max bet if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most slot machines offer bonus rounds and other special features that can only be activated by betting the max amount. If you’re looking to win big, playing the max bet is always a good idea. Just be sure that you have enough cash on hand to cover it!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Know when to quit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even with the best intentions, it’s easy to get carried away while playing slots. Before you know it, hours may have passed and you may have lost more money than you intended. Know when to quit and walk away from the machine - especially if you’re already up!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Pick-the-Right-Slot-Machine-for-You"><a href="#How-to-Pick-the-Right-Slot-Machine-for-You" class="headerlink" title="How to Pick the Right Slot Machine for You"></a>How to Pick the Right Slot Machine for You</h1><p>A slot machine can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to pick the right one for you. Here are a few tips on how to pick the right slot machine:</p>
<p>-First, consider how much money you’re willing to spend. Slot machines can be expensive, so make sure you’re comfortable with the amount of money you’re betting.</p>
<p>-Next, think about what kind of player you are. Some slot machines are more complicated than others, and if you’re not used to playing slots, you might want to start with a simpler machine.</p>
<p>-Finally, pay attention to the payout percentage. This is the percentage of money that the machine pays back to players. The higher the payout percentage, the better your chances of winning money back.</p>

The poker prodigy known as “The Kid” found four aces in his hand and won the game, and the $1 million prize.</p>
<p> onlookers were in shock as the dealer spread the cards on the table. It was clear that The Kid had won, and he took home the biggest prize in poker history.</p>
<p>The Kid’s remarkable victory has made him a household name, and people are beginning to take notice of his amazing skills. He is already considered one of the best poker players in the world, and there is no telling what he will achieve next.</p>
<p>Many experts are calling The Kid the new “Prince of Poker”, and it’s clear that he is destined for greatness. He has already shown that he can beat the best players in the world, and there is no stopping him now.</p>
<p>The Kid’s victory is a testament to his skill and determination. He has worked hard to become one of the best poker players in the world, and now he has proven that he can win against anyone.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-There-Are-720-Possible-Poker-Hands-with-Four-of-a-Kind"><a href="#Study-Shows-There-Are-720-Possible-Poker-Hands-with-Four-of-a-Kind" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows There Are 720 Possible Poker Hands with Four of a Kind"></a>Study Shows There Are 720 Possible Poker Hands with Four of a Kind</h1><p>According to a new study, there are 720 possible poker hands with four of a kind. This may come as a surprise to some, as many people believe that there are only 222 different possible hands. The research was conducted by game theory experts at the University of Nottingham and is believed to be the most comprehensive study of its kind to date.</p>
<p>The findings could have a significant impact on the way poker is played, as they provide players with a more accurate understanding of the probabilities involved. In particular, the study found that the likelihood of getting four of a kind is 1 in 685, which is significantly higher than the 1 in 624 odds that were previously thought to exist.</p>
<p>The research also found that there are only two possible five of a kind hands, compared to the ten that were previously believed to exist. This has important implications for tournament play, as it means that players are much less likely to see this particular hand.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by analysing over two million private poker hands that had been played online. This data was then used to create a computer simulation which calculated all possible combinations of cards. The results were then verified by human experts who have extensive knowledge of Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>The researchers say that their findings could help to improve the game for all players, regardless of their level of experience. In addition, they believe that the study could pave the way for further research into other variants of poker.</p>

There Are More Than 1,000 Ways to Win with Four of a Kind"></a>Bingo! There Are More Than 1,000 Ways to Win with Four of a Kind</h1><p>Regular bingo is a fun game, but it’s even more exciting when you add in an extra twist. With four of a kind, there are more than 1,000 ways to win. </p>
<p>To start, each player is given four cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the table, and the other three are placed in front of the player. The player then takes turns drawing cards from the deck and placing them next to the first card. If any of the drawn cards match those on the first card, the player marks them off. When all four cards have been marked off, the player wins.</p>
<p>There are 1,024 possible combinations with four of a kind. In order to win, the player only needs to match two out of three cards on the first card. This can be done in so many ways that there are plenty of chances for everyone to win. For example, if one card has two kings and two queens, another has two jacks and two tens, and a third has two threes and two fives, then any combination of those cards will result in a winner. </p>
<p>Here are just a few possibilities:<br>2 Kings 2 Queens &#x3D; WON<br>2 Kings 2 Jokers &#x3D; WON<br>2 Queens 2 Jokers &#x3D; WON<br>3 Kings 1 Queen &#x3D; WON<br>4 Kings 0 Queens &#x3D; LOST</p>

<p>One of the most important things to do before playing in a poker tournament is to familiarize yourself with the format. In general, there are two types of tournaments: freeze out and rebuy. In a freeze out tournament, players can only enter once and cannot re-buy chips if they run out. Conversely, in a rebuy tournament players can buy more chips whenever they like, as long as they have enough money in their account.</p>
<p>Knowing which type of tournament you’re playing in is key to formulating a winning strategy. For example, if you know that the other players at your table are likely to be inexperienced rebuy players, then you may want to bluff them more aggressively than you would in a freeze out tournament.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Come Prepared with Enough Funds</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when playing in a poker tournament is making sure you have enough funds available. Most tournaments have an entry fee as well as a buy-in requirement; so make sure you have enough cash on hand to cover both of those costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, remember that you’ll also need money for food and drinks (unless the casino provides them for free). So be sure to bring extra money just in case – you don’t want to end up running out of funds midway through the tournament!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Play Aggressively but Smartly</li>
</ol>

<p>In poker, a four of a kind is a hand that contains four cards of the same rank, such as 4♣ 4♥ 4♦ 4♠.</p>
<p>There are 1,096 possible ways to receive four-of-a-kind if you are playing with six cards. This can be done by receiving one card of each rank twice (2x2x2x2x2), two cards of one rank and two different ranks (1x4x3x2), three cards of one rank and one different rank (3x3x1) or four different ranks (4x4).</p>
<p>There are 654,064 total possible poker hands if you are playing with six cards. This means that the probability of being dealt a four of a kind is 1 in 654,064 or 0.000015%.</p>
<p>That’s pretty slim odds, but if you are lucky enough to be dealt this hand, you’ll have plenty of bragging rights at the table.</p>

It’s not your typical casino, though. This casino is in one of the most remote places on Earth and it only accepts one currency: penguin pelts.</p>
<p>If you want to play blackjack in this casino, you first need to know how to play blackjack. The basic rules are simple: try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand. There are a few twists that make the game more challenging in the Antarctic casino, though.</p>
<p>First, all of the cards are worth face value, except for the ace, which is worth 1 or 11 points, whichever works better for your hand. Second, if you bust (go over 21), you lose automatically, no matter what the dealer has. Third, dealers always hit on 16 and stand on 17.</p>
<p>The game can be played with anywhere from 1 to 8 decks of cards. With 1 deck, there are only 16 potential player hands (2 per each rank), so the odds are slightly different than with a full deck of 52 cards. In general, the house edge is about 0.5% when playing with perfect strategy.</p>
<p>Once you know how to play blackjack, it’s time to head to the Antarctic casino! The casino is open 24 hours a day and there’s always a game available. Just be sure to bring plenty of penguin pelts (the currency of the casino) with you, because they don’t accept any other form of currency.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Blackjack-in-the-Frozen-Continent"><a href="#Playing-Blackjack-in-the-Frozen-Continent" class="headerlink" title="Playing Blackjack in the Frozen Continent"></a>Playing Blackjack in the Frozen Continent</h1><p>In the middle of the frozen continent, there is a small, but popular casino. The casino is well known for its Blackjack tables, which are always packed with players. </p>
<p>The many Blackjack games at this casino offer a wide variety of betting options and table limits. Players can choose to bet on just one hand, or they can bet on multiple hands simultaneously. In addition, the minimum and maximum bets vary from table to table. </p>
<p>Casino staff are knowledgeable about Blackjack strategy and are happy to help players make decisions that will give them the best chance of winning. In addition, free drinks are available to players who are gambling in the casino. </p>
<p>Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, the casino’s Blackjack tables provide a great opportunity to have some fun and potentially win some money.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-the-Rules-of-Blackjack-for-Casino-Gaming-in-Antarctica"><a href="#Learn-the-Rules-of-Blackjack-for-Casino-Gaming-in-Antarctica" class="headerlink" title="Learn the Rules of Blackjack for Casino Gaming in Antarctica"></a>Learn the Rules of Blackjack for Casino Gaming in Antarctica</h1><p>When playing blackjack in a casino, it is important to be aware of the rules and gameplay. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games and can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. To learn more about how to play blackjack and improve your chances of winning, read on.</p>
<p>The basic objective of blackjack is to achieve a hand value that is greater than that of the dealer, without exceeding 21. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and each card has a corresponding point value. Players are dealt two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face down and one card face up. The aim is to take as many cards as possible until you reach 21 or over, at which point you ‘stand’. The value of your hand is the sum total of the points on your individual cards. So, for example, if you are dealt an Ace and a 6, your hand value would be 7 (ie 1+6&#x3D;7).</p>
<p>If your first two cards form a pair (eg two Kings), you have the option to ‘split’ them into two separate hands, which allows you to bet on both hands separately. If you split a pair of Aces for example, you would then receive another card for each Ace (therefore ending up with three cards per hand). Note that if you split a pair of 10s or face cards, you only receive one more card per hand. If the total point value of your three cards exceeds 21 (ie you go bust), then you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s hand turns out to be.</p>
<p>If the dealer has an Ace visible (face up), they will offer insurance to players. Insurance costs half of your original bet amount and if the dealer has blackjack (Ace + any other card), then players who have taken insurance will win 2-1 on their bets - meaning they break even overall. It’s important to remember though that if the dealer does not have blackjack, then players who have taken insurance will lose their bets!</p>
<p>The main aim when playing blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going bust - this can be achieved by either getting as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, or by forcing the dealer to go bust by taking more cards than them. Remember that if both player and dealer achieve 21 at the same time (a ‘push’), then no money changes hands and everyone just gets their bets back. By familiarising yourself with these concepts and practicing a little before hitting the casino floor, you can give yourself a better chance at winning some real cash!</p>

Here are some tips to make your experience more enjoyable:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Dress warmly. It can be chilly inside a casino on ice, so be sure to dress in layers. A coat, hat, and gloves are essential.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring a drinking game. Playing blackjack can make you thirsty, so be sure to bring a drinking game to help keep you hydrated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure your phone is charged. There’s nothing worse than running out of battery life in the middle of a game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have fun! The most important thing is to enjoy yourself. Casino games can be thrilling, so take advantage of that and have some fun!</p>

However, a recent study has found that the drug may also lead to gambling addiction in some patients.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at data from more than 11,000 people who were taking Abilify or other similar medications. The researchers found that those who were taking Abilify were twice as likely to develop a gambling addiction as those who were not taking the drug.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences, including financial ruin and emotional distress. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many treatments available for gambling addiction, including counseling and therapy.</p>
<h1 id="Abilify-Linked-to-Increased-Risk-of-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Abilify-Linked-to-Increased-Risk-of-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Abilify Linked to Increased Risk of Gambling Addiction"></a>Abilify Linked to Increased Risk of Gambling Addiction</h1><p>Prescription drug Abilify has been linked to an increased risk of gambling addiction, according to a study recently published in the journal Addiction.</p>
<p>The study found that people who took Abilify were more likely to develop a gambling addiction than those who did not take the drug.</p>
<p>Abilify is used to treat mental health conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder. It is also sometimes prescribed to help people with weight loss.</p>
<p>Researchers analyzed data from more than 26,000 people who had been diagnosed with a gambling addiction and more than 290,000 people who did not have a gambling addiction. They found that those who had taken Abilify were almost twice as likely to develop a gambling addiction as those who had not taken the drug.</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that the findings “support the inclusion of gambling disorder in the list of potential adverse effects associated with Abilify use.”</p>
<p>Abilify has already been linked to a number of other side effects, including:<br>– agitation<br>– anxiety<br>– diarrhea<br>– dizziness<br>– drowsiness<br>– headache<br>– nausea</p>
<h1 id="Abilify-Can-Lead-to-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Abilify-Can-Lead-to-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Abilify Can Lead to Gambling Addiction"></a>Abilify Can Lead to Gambling Addiction</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a recognized psychiatric disorder that can be extremely harmful to both the individual and their loved ones. Abilify (aripiprazole) is a drug frequently prescribed to treat various mental health disorders, including gambling addiction.</p>
<p>However, a recent study has shown that Abilify may actually increase the likelihood of developing a gambling addiction. The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, looked at data from over 5,000 individuals who had been prescribed Abilify.</p>
<p>The study found that those who were taking Abilify had a threefold increased risk of developing a gambling addiction than those who were not taking the drug. This increased risk was even more pronounced in those under the age of 18.</p>
<p>While the study does not prove that Abilify causes gambling addiction, it does raise serious concerns about the potential risks of this drug. If you or someone you know is taking Abilify and has developed a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help immediately.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Is-Abilify-Causing-So-Many-Cases-of-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Why-Is-Abilify-Causing-So-Many-Cases-of-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Abilify Causing So Many Cases of Gambling Addiction?"></a>Why Is Abilify Causing So Many Cases of Gambling Addiction?</h1><p>Abilify is a medication that is used to treat a number of psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, it has been linked to a number of cases of gambling addiction. Why is this happening, and what can be done about it?</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have a negative impact on both the individual and their loved ones. It can cause financial problems, relationship issues, and even physical health problems.</p>
<p>So why is Abilify causing so many cases of gambling addiction? There are several possible reasons.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Abilify may increase the risk of developing a gambling addiction in some individuals. This may be due to the fact that Abilify affects certain chemicals in the brain that are involved in pleasure and reward.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that people who are already at risk of developing a gambling addiction may be more likely to start gambling if they take Abilify. This may be because Abilify makes them feel more confident or less anxious, which can lead to risky behaviour.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible that some doctors are not aware of the link between Abilify and gambling addiction, and are therefore prescribing it to patients who might be at risk.</p>
<p>So what can be done about this issue? The first step is for doctors and patients to be aware of the potential risks associated with taking Abilify. If you are taking this medication, it is important to discuss any concerns you have about gambling with your doctor.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you or someone you know may have a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available, including counselling and support groups.</p>
<h1 id="How-Can-I-Protect-Myself-from-Abilify’s-Risk-for-Causing-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#How-Can-I-Protect-Myself-from-Abilify’s-Risk-for-Causing-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Protect Myself from Abilify’s Risk for Causing Gambling Addiction?"></a>How Can I Protect Myself from Abilify’s Risk for Causing Gambling Addiction?</h1><p>There is a risk for developing a gambling addiction when taking Abilify, but there are ways to protect yourself. If you are susceptible to gambling addiction, be sure to take the lowest dose of Abilify possible and monitor your behavior closely. If you notice any signs of problem gambling, talk to your doctor immediately. You may also want to avoid taking Abilify if you have a history of gambling addiction or other addictive behaviors.</p>

        <h1 id="Illinois-Amends-Gaming-Law-to-Allow-Wagering-Machines"><a href="#Illinois-Amends-Gaming-Law-to-Allow-Wagering-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Amends Gaming Law to Allow Wagering Machines"></a>Illinois Amends Gaming Law to Allow Wagering Machines</h1><p>On Wednesday, the Illinois Senate voted to amend the state’s gaming law to include wagering machines. Amended Bill SB1849 now goes back to the House for final approval before being sent to Governor J.B. Pritzker to be signed into law.</p>
<p>The amended bill allows licensed establishments, such as bars and truck stops, to offer up to five video gambling machines. The maximum bet per machine is $2, with a limit of $10 per player per day. Establishments must also dedicate at least 40% of their profits from machine wagering to charity.</p>
<p>Supporters of the amendment argue that it will provide much-needed revenue to struggling communities and charities. “We know that this is a form of gaming that people want,” said State Senator Terry Link (D-Lake County). “It will help generate revenues in areas where they are sorely needed.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the amendment argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and social ills. “This is going to create more addicts, more broken marriages, more problems in our society,” said State Senator Dave Syverson (R-Rockford). “It’s going to be a disaster.”</p>
<p>Governor Pritzker has not yet indicated whether he will sign the amended bill into law.</p>

The recommendation is in response to a increasing demand for such machines, which are currently being used illegally in many establishments.</p>
<p>The proposed licensing would allow for up to 5,000 machines to be placed in establishments across Illinois. The Board estimates that the licensing would generate over $60 million in revenue annually, which would be used to fund programs for problem gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposal argue that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates. However, supporters assert that the licensing will bring much needed revenue to the state while also providing responsible regulation of the machines.</p>

The previous deadline was October 1, and the new deadline is November 1.</p>
<p>This extension provides more time for interested parties to submit their applications and allows the Illinois Gaming Board additional time to review the submissions. The board has not yet announced when it will award the licenses.</p>

The proposal outlined the licensing requirements and gave interested parties until October 1, 2017 to submit their applications.</p>
<p>The licensing requirements include a minimum capital investment of $2 million, background checks for all key personnel, and compliance with local zoning regulations. The licenses are valid for five years and can be renewed.</p>

The licenses were issued to 10 companies, who will now have the ability to operate the machines at the various race tracks.</p>
<p>The issuance of licenses comes as good news for those in the gambling industry, as it provides a new way to generate revenue. It is also expected to create new jobs in the area. In addition, the machines are anticipated to draw more people to the tracks, which should help to boost attendance and betting totals.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a positive one by many, as it will allow Illinois residents to place bets on horse races in a convenient and easy manner. Those who are granted a license will be able to set up their machines at any of the state’s horse racing tracks.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a license, companies must submit an application that includes information about their proposed operation. They must also pay a fee of $5,000 per machine. The machines must also meet specific requirements, including being located in an area that is easily visible to patrons.</p>

<p>The licenses were awarded to a variety of businesses, including restaurants, bars, and truck stops. The establishments will be able to offer the terminals starting on January 1st, 2019.</p>
<p>The Illinois Gaming Board held a meeting on Wednesday to award the licenses. In addition to the nine establishments that won licenses, eleven other businesses were approved to offer wagering terminals but did not win licenses.</p>
<p>The nine establishments that won licenses are located in Addison, Batavia, Elmhurst, Franklin Park, Homer Glen, Itasca, Lisle, Morton Grove, and Wheeler.</p>
<p>Governor Bruce Rauner applauded the decision, saying that it would create jobs and help expand tourism in the state. He added that the expansion of gaming in Illinois would make the state more competitive with its neighboring states.</p>

While there is no doubt that some people can become hooked on gaming to the point where it interferes with other aspects of their lives, it is important to remember that for most people, gaming is a harmless hobby.</p>
<p>That said, if you are worried that you or someone you love might be addicted to video games, there are a number of therapists who specialize in treating gaming addiction on Long Island. Here are a few of them:</p>

<h1 id="Newly-Identified-Disorder-Therapists-on-LI-Treat-Gaming-Addiction-Casino-Chip"><a href="#Newly-Identified-Disorder-Therapists-on-LI-Treat-Gaming-Addiction-Casino-Chip" class="headerlink" title="Newly Identified Disorder: Therapists on LI Treat Gaming Addiction Casino Chip"></a>Newly Identified Disorder: Therapists on LI Treat Gaming Addiction Casino Chip</h1><p>A new study published in the journal “Addictive Behaviors” has identified a previously unrecognized disorder: gaming addiction. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at Stony Brook University, found that a significant number of people who regularly play video games may be addicted to them.</p>
<p>The researchers surveyed nearly 1,500 gamers and found that 9% of them met the criteria for gaming addiction. This means that they were unable to control their gaming habits, were preoccupied with thoughts of gaming, and exhibited withdrawal symptoms when they weren’t able to game.</p>
<p>Participants who met the criteria for addiction reported playing an average of 33 hours per week. They also said that they felt irritable and restless when they weren’t playing video games and had problems completing daily tasks due to their gaming habits.</p>
<p>Dr. Jason academician at SUNY says these results are alarming and indicative of a real problem that needs to be addressed. “It’s not just a problem with children anymore,” he says. “It’s now something that’s affecting adults as well.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that more research is needed to determine whether or not gaming addiction should be classified as its own disorder. In the meantime, they advise people who think they may be addicted to gaming to seek out professional help.</p>

LI Therapists Say Yes for Some Patients Casino Chip</h1><p>This is an article about gambling addiction and whether or not it should be considered a mental health disorder. </p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a real problem for many people. It can destroy relationships, careers, and even lives. But is it really a mental health disorder?</p>
<p>According to some LI therapists, the answer is yes. They say that gambling addiction can be just as debilitating as any other addiction, and that it should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Others argue that gambling addiction is not a mental health disorder, but rather a behavioral problem. They claim that it can be treated with therapy and self-control techniques.</p>
<p>So who is right? Is gambling addiction a mental health disorder or not?</p>
<p>The truth is, there is no definitive answer. Gambling addiction may or may not be considered a mental health disorder depending on who you ask. However, there is no doubt that gambling addiction can be very harmful and should be taken seriously.</p>

She would watch in fascination as he placed his bets and she was always so excited when she would get to go home with a small bag of brightly colored chips. As she got older, Jane started to experiment with gambling on her own and before long, she was hooked. She loved the thrill of risking it all and watching the numbers on the screen change.</p>
<p>Jane’s gambling addiction quickly spiraled out of control and before long, she was spending all her money on casino games. She stopped paying rent and started borrowing money from friends and family members. She even maxed out her credit cards trying to chase her losses. Jane was in total denial about her addiction and refused to seek help.</p>
<p>As her debts mounted, Jane’s life started to unravel. Her relationships with friends and family deteriorated and she became more and more isolated. She stopped going to work and spent all day everyday in front of the slot machines or at the roulette table. Her health began to suffer as well and she started to lose weight because she couldn’t bring herself to eat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one day, Jane hit rock bottom. She realized that she had lost everything–her job, her home, her money, and most importantly, her dignity. She finally decided to seek help for her gambling addiction and entered into a rehab program.</p>
<p>It was a difficult journey but with the support of her rehab counselors and fellow patients, Jane finally got the help she needed. After completing the program, she started working on rebuilding her life one step at a time. She got a new job, moved into a new apartment, and slowly started to pay back her debts.</p>
<p>Jane is now 5 years sober and is happily married with two children. She credits her recovery not only to rehab but also to Al-Anon, a 12-step program for families of alcoholics. Without the support of both programs, Jane doesn’t think she would be alive today. She is living proof that no matter how bad things seem at first, there is always hope for a better future.</p>

        <h1 id="Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Advantages and Disadvantages of Legalized Gambling"></a>Advantages and Disadvantages of Legalized Gambling</h1><p>When it comes to the legalization of gambling, there are many pros and cons to consider. On one hand, legalized gambling can bring in much-needed revenue to a state or country, while providing employment opportunities and tourism benefits. On the other hand, legalized gambling can have negative consequences such as addiction, financial hardship, and crime. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of legalized gambling.</p>
<p>Advantages of Legalized Gambling</p>
<p>#1 – Revenue Generation</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of legalizing gambling is the potential for increased government revenue. Gambling revenues can be used to fund important government programs and services, such as education, health care, public safety, and infrastructure projects. In fact, in some cases, gambling revenues have accounted for a significant percentage of a state or country’s overall budget.</p>
<p>#2 – Employment Opportunities</p>
<p>Another advantage of legalized gambling is that it can create jobs. The gaming industry is typically associated with high levels of employment, particularly in areas like customer service, marketing, and accounting. In addition, when casinos are built, they often lead to the development of new businesses and services in the surrounding area, creating even more jobs.</p>
<p>#3 – Tourism Benefits</p>
<p>Legalized gambling can also bring in tourists who are eager to experience the thrill of betting in a casino or playing the slots. This increased tourism can generate substantial revenue for local businesses and restaurants. It can also create new jobs in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Legalized Gambling</p>
<p>#1 – Addiction Risk</p>
<p>One major downside of legalized gambling is that it can lead to addiction. Gamblers can easily develop an unhealthy dependence on wagering which can ruin their personal finances and relationships. Additionally, problem gamblers may turn to criminal activity in order to get money to gamble with.</p>
<p>#2 – Financial Hardship</p>
<h1 id="The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Pros and Cons of Legalized Gambling"></a>The Pros and Cons of Legalized Gambling</h1><p>A heated debate that has resurfaced in the United States in recent years is the topic of legalized gambling. On one side of the argument, supporters maintain that legalizing gambling could bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states and create jobs. They also argue that it is a personal choice for people to gamble or not, and that prohibition does not work.</p>
<p>Opponents of gambling legalization argue that it is a regressive tax that disproportionately hurts the poor, and that it leads to social harms such as addiction and crime. They also maintain that gambling is a problem with no benefits, and that it should remain illegal to protect people from its potential dangers.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at both sides of the argument:</p>
<p>PRO: LEGALIZING GAMBLING COULD BRING IN REVENUE TO STATES</p>
<p>One of the primary arguments in favor of legalizing gambling is financial. Proponents say that allowing gambling operations – whether through casinos, lotteries, or racetracks – would bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states. For example, a 2016 study by the University of New Hampshire found that if New Hampshire were to legalize all forms of casino gambling, it could expect to see an increase in state revenues of between $48 million and $122 million per year.</p>
<p>In addition to generating revenue for states, proponents argue that legalized gambling can create jobs. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that the gambling industry supports 1.7 million jobs in the United States. These jobs include everything from casino employees to those who make and sell lottery tickets.</p>
<p>CON: LEGALIZING GAMBLING COULD HURT THE POOREST AMERICANS<br>Milton Friedman famously said: “There is no such thing as a free lunch” – and this applies to legalized gambling as well. Opponents of gambling legalization argue that while casinos and other gaming establishments may generate tax revenue for states, they also place an unfair financial burden on poor Americans. This is because low-income individuals are more likely to be affected by problem gambling than those who are wealthier.</p>
<p>In fact, a study by The National Council on Problem Gambling found that people with annual incomes below $20,000 were twice as likely as those earning $75,000 or more to experience problems due to gambling. Therefore, opponents say, legalizing gambling would only exacerbate economic inequality in America.</p>
<p>PRO: IT IS A PERSONAL CHOICE FOR PEOPLE TO GAMBLE OR NOT<br>Another key argument made by proponents of legalized gambling is that it is a personal choice for people to wager or not wager their money. They say prohibition does not work – just look at America’s failed history with alcohol prohibition – and that if people want to gamble, they should be allowed to do so without interference from the government.</p>
<p>CON: GAMBLING HAS NO BENEFITS; IT SHOULD REMAIN ILLEGAL TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM ITS POTENTIAL DANGERS</p>
<p>On the other side of the argument, opponents of legalization say that there are no benefits to legalized gambling whatsoever. Rather than generating tax revenue or creating jobs, they argue, legalized gambling actually causes social harms such as addiction and crime. In addition, they assert that it preys on vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those who are struggling financially.</p>
<p>For these reasons, they maintain that it should remain illegal to protect people from its potential dangers.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#What-are-the-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Legalized Gambling?"></a>What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Legalized Gambling?</h1><p>A little more than a decade ago, Connecticut residents voted in favor of casino gambling in the state. This was a controversial decision at the time, as many people felt that legalized gambling would have negative consequences for the state. So, what have been the advantages and disadvantages of legalized gambling in Connecticut?</p>
<p>One of the clear advantages of legalized gambling is that it has generated significant revenue for the state. In fact, in 2017 casino gaming brought in over $1 billion to Connecticut’s coffers. This money has been used to fund important programs and services, such as education and transportation.</p>
<p>Another advantage of legalized gambling is that it has created jobs. The casino industry employs thousands of people in Connecticut, and those jobs are important sources of income for families in the state.</p>
<p>However, there are also some disadvantages to legalized gambling. For one thing, it can lead to problem gambling, which can have negative consequences for individuals and their families. Additionally, casinos can be harmful to local communities, as they can attract crime and lead to increased rates of poverty.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Pros-and-Cons-of-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#What-are-the-Pros-and-Cons-of-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What are the Pros and Cons of Legalized Gambling?"></a>What are the Pros and Cons of Legalized Gambling?</h1><p>The legalization of gambling has been a topic of debate for many years. Supporters of legalization argue that it would be a financial boon to the government, while opponents argue that it would lead to an increase in crime and addictive behavior. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of legalized gambling.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gambling can be a major source of revenue for the government.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can create jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can attract tourists to a destination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling can be fun and entertaining.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gambling can be addictive and lead to ruined lives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can lead to increased crime rates as people desperate for money turn to criminal activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can be harmful to the economy as people lose more money than they can afford to lose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can have negative social consequences, such as increased rates of divorce and child neglect.</p>

Today, gambling is a legal and Multi-Billion dollar industry in many parts of the world. Gambling can be done in a casino, at the race track, or online. There are many advantages and disadvantages to legalized gambling.</p>
<p>The main advantage of legalized gambling is that it generates tax revenue for the government. This money can be used to fund important government programs such as education, infrastructure, and healthcare. Gambling also creates jobs in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of legalized gambling is that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for some people. There is also a risk that criminals will use gambling establishments to launder money.</p>

        <h1 id="Saudi-Arabia-to-Ban-In-Casino-Hijri-Gambling"><a href="#Saudi-Arabia-to-Ban-In-Casino-Hijri-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Saudi Arabia to Ban In-Casino Hijri Gambling"></a>Saudi Arabia to Ban In-Casino Hijri Gambling</h1><p>According to a government official, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Culture and Information is drafting a law that will prohibit gambling in all forms in the country, including games using the Hijri calendar.</p>
<p>This move is likely an attempt to crack down on illegal gambling, as well as to protect citizens from potential harm associated with gambling addiction. Minister of Culture and Information Awwad bin Saleh Alawwad commented on the ban, saying:</p>
<p>“The proposed law prohibits all types of gambling, whether it is based on regional or international calendars. It also forbids any type of betting or wagering, regardless of the amount.”</p>
<p>The minister added that violators of the proposed law would face penalties, including imprisonment and&#x2F;or fines. The draft law has not yet been released to the public for review.</p>
<p>This decision marks a significant change for Saudi Arabia, which has traditionally allowed some forms of gambling. However, with the rise of online casinos and other types of remote gambling, authorities have become increasingly concerned about the social and financial harms associated with gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Malaysia-Bans-Online-Islamic-Baccarat"><a href="#Malaysia-Bans-Online-Islamic-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Malaysia Bans Online Islamic Baccarat"></a>Malaysia Bans Online Islamic Baccarat</h1><p>On July 1, 2019, the Malaysian government announced a ban on online Islamic baccarat. Deputy Prime Minister Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said that the decision was made in order to protect the people of Malaysia from the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>Islamic baccarat is a form of gambling that is based on the principles of Islam. It is played with cards and involves betting on which of two hands (the player’s or the banker’s) will be closer to nine. There are many different versions of Islamic baccarat, but all of them involve some form of gambling.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government has not prohibited online gambling altogether; instead, it has only banned those games that involve gambling. Other popular online games such as poker, blackjack and roulette are still allowed in Malaysia.</p>
<p>The announcement of the ban was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people welcomed it as a step in the right direction, while others argued that it was unnecessary and would only lead to more underground gambling activities.</p>
<p>Islamic baccarat is popular in other Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia and Turkey. In Indonesia, there are currently no regulations governing its legality, although there have been calls for it to be banned. In Turkey, Islamic baccarat is legal and regulated by the government.</p>
<h1 id="Indonesian-cleric-proposes-ban-on-baccarat-games-for-Muslims"><a href="#Indonesian-cleric-proposes-ban-on-baccarat-games-for-Muslims" class="headerlink" title="Indonesian cleric proposes ban on baccarat games for Muslims"></a>Indonesian cleric proposes ban on baccarat games for Muslims</h1><p>An Indonesian cleric has called for a ban on baccarat games for Muslims, saying they are too sinful.</p>
<p>“Baccarat is haram (forbidden) because it involves gambling, which is forbidden in Islam,” cleric Yusuf Mansyur said this week.</p>
<p>Mansyur, who is also the chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council’s fatwa commission, said that other casino games were permissible for Muslims as they did not involve gambling.</p>
<p>The call for a ban on baccarat games came after several high-profile cases of alleged gambling fraud at casinos in Indonesia. In one recent case, a group of men were caught cheating at a casino in the city of Surabaya, with police saying they had used marked cards to win millions of rupiah.</p>
<p>Officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs have said that they will study Mansyur’s proposal to see if it is feasible. However, it is likely to face resistance from the country’s gaming industry, which is worth an estimated $2 billion annually.</p>
<p>Indonesia is home to the world’s second-largest Muslim population, with around 225 million followers of the faith. However, there are no specific rules or regulations governing gambling activities for Muslims in the country.</p>
<h1 id="Egypt’s-Mufti-bans-baccarat-games-in-hotels-casinos"><a href="#Egypt’s-Mufti-bans-baccarat-games-in-hotels-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Egypt’s Mufti bans baccarat games in hotels, casinos"></a>Egypt’s Mufti bans baccarat games in hotels, casinos</h1><p>Egypt’s top Muslim cleric has called for a ban on baccarat games in the country, saying they are un-Islamic.</p>
<p>Grand Mufti Shawki Allam said in a statement Tuesday that the fast-paced, card game is “a waste of money and time.”</p>
<p>He also called on authorities to close down casinos in Egypt, describing them as places of “vice and depravity.”</p>
<p>There are currently five casinos in the country, but it was not clear if they will be affected by the mufti’s call.<br>Baccarat is popular among high-rollers and often played in exclusive rooms at casinos.</p>
<p>The mufti’s pronouncement comes as Egypt seeks to revive its tourism sector, which took a hit after the 2011 uprising</p>
<h1 id="Kuwaiti-lawmaker-seeks-to-ban-baccarat-game-over-its-‘sinful’-nature"><a href="#Kuwaiti-lawmaker-seeks-to-ban-baccarat-game-over-its-‘sinful’-nature" class="headerlink" title="Kuwaiti lawmaker seeks to ban baccarat game over its ‘sinful’ nature"></a>Kuwaiti lawmaker seeks to ban baccarat game over its ‘sinful’ nature</h1><p>Kuwaiti National Assembly member Mohammad Hayef has submitted a proposal seeking to ban the playing of baccarat in the country over its ‘sinful’ nature.</p>
<p>The lawmaker said that baccarat, a popular casino game, encourages gambling and is against Sharia law. If passed, the proposal would make it illegal for any person or company to operate a baccarat game in Kuwait.</p>
<p>“This game is based on luck and not skills, which could lead many people astray,” Hayef was quoted as saying by the local media.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a card game where players bet on who will be dealt the next highest point value card. The first player to reach nine points (or as close as possible) with two cards wins the hand. The game can be played with either one or three decks of cards.</p>
<p>Despite being considered a simple game, baccarat can be frustrating for players who lose money quickly. This has resulted in some people calling it the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’.</p>
<p>While there is no official data on how much money is gambled on baccarat each year, experts believe that it is a multi-billion dollar industry. In 2017, Macau – a special administrative region of China – generated more than $33 billion from gambling activities, with most of that coming from baccarat games.</p>
<p>While Kuwait does not have casinos like Macau, there are several private clubs in the country that offer baccarat games. It is not clear if Hayef’s proposal will be implemented but, if it is approved, those caught playing or operating a baccarat game could face fines or imprisonment.</p>
