<p>To make the machine, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry pi </li>
<li>A motor controller </li>
<li>A stepper motor </li>
<li>Candy dispenser </li>
<li>Slot machine cabinet </li>
<li>Power supply </li>
<li>Stepper motor driver </li>
<li>Wires </li>
<li>Breadboard</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to assemble the hardware. Mount the raspberry pi, motor controller, and stepper motor in the slot machine cabinet. If you are using a different cabinet, you will need to modify the instructions accordingly. Next, connect the power supply to the raspberry pi and the motor controller. Finally, wire the stepper motor to the motor controller. [ links to wiring diagrams ]</p>
<p>The software for the slot machine is based on raspbian, so you will need to install it on your raspberry pi. Once raspbian is installed, you will need to update it and install some additional software. Open a terminal window and run the following commands:<br>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;&amp; sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libpython3-dev -y<br>Next, you will need to clone the github repository for our project:git clone <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/thomashowell/raspberrypi_slot_machine">https://github.com/thomashowell/raspberrypi_slot_machine</a> This repository contains all of the source code for our project.<br> cd raspberrypi_slot_machine Finally, run the following command to install all of the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt . This command will install all of the required Python libraries for our project. You may need to run this command as root if you are not currently logged in as root user.<br>Now that everything is installed, you can start working on the code for our slot machine. The first step is to import all of the necessary libraries:import os import time import random from pycontrolledStepper import ControlledStepper from spidev import SPI # Set up GPIO pins GPIOzero &#x3D; os . environ [ “GPIOzero” ] if GPIOzero &#x3D;&#x3D; “on” : print ( “GPIOzero environment variable is set.” ) else : print ( “GPIOzero environment variable is not set.” ) print ( “You can find more information at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/gpiozero/&quot;">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/gpiozero/&quot;</a> ) # Set up SPI interface spi &#x3D; SPI ( 0 , 0 ) clock &#x3D; spi . frequency ( 100000 ) # Define various constants STEPSIZE &#x3D; 5 PIN_SELECTOR &#x3D; 7 CANDYBOX_PIN &#x3D; 25 MAXCOUNT &#x3D; 50 DISPLAYTIME &#x3D; 5 def main (): while True : # Get input from user input &#x3D; input () # Check if input matches one of our predefined options if input &#x3D;&#x3D; “start” or input &#x3D;&#x3D; “go” : candies &#x3D; 0 totalcount &#x3D; 0 startTime &#x3D; time . time () elif input &#x3D;&#x3D; “stop” or input &#x3D;&#x3D; “quit” : break else : print ( “‘{}’ is not a valid input.” . format ( input )) # Display current status displayStatus ( candies , totalcount ) # Move stepper motor forward or backward based on input if input &#x3D;&#x3D; “left” or “right” : leftSteps () elif input &#x3D;&#x3D; “forward” or input &#x3D;&#x3D; “+1” : forwardSteps () elif input &#x3D;&#x3D; “-1” or input &#x3D;&#x3D; “backward” : backwardSteps () def leftSteps (): global leftSteps deltaTimeLeft &#x3D; time . time () - startTime stepSizeDeltaLeft &#x3D; deltaTimeLeft &#x2F; STEPSIZE LeftMotorState &#x3D; spi . xxxx while LeftMotorState !&#x3D; 2 and LeftMotorState !&#x3D; 3 : LeftMotorState &#x3D; spi . read ( 1 ) stepSizeDeltaLeft *&#x3D; 2 leftSteps +&#x3D; 1 sleep ( stepSizeDeltaLeft ) def forwardSteps (): global forwardSteps deltaTimeForward &#x3D; time . time () - startTime stepSizeDeltaForward &#x3D; deltaTimeForward &#x2F; STEPSIZE ForwardMotorState &#x3D; spi . xxxx while ForwardMotorState !&#x3D; 2 and ForwardMotorState !&#x3D; 3 : ForwardMotorState &#x3D; spi . read ( 1 ) stepSizeDeltaForward *&#x3D; 2 forwardSteps +&#x3D; 1 sleep ( stepSizeDeltaForward ) def backwardSteps (): global backwardSteps deltaTimeBackward &#x3D; time . time () - startTime stepSizeDeltaBackward &#x3D; deltaTimeBackward &#x2F; STEPSIZE BackwardMotorState &#x3D; spi . xxxx while BackwardMotorState !&#x3D; 2 and BackwardMotorState !&#x3D; 3 : BackwardMotorState &#x3D; spi . read ( 1 ) stepSizeDeltaBackward *&#x3D; 2 backwardSteps +&#x3D; 1 sleep ( stepSizeDeltaBackward ) if <strong>name</strong> &#x3D;&#x3D; ‘<strong>main</strong>‘ : main ()</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-that-pays-out"><a href="#How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-that-pays-out" class="headerlink" title="How to make a raspberry pi slot machine that pays out"></a>How to make a raspberry pi slot machine that pays out</h1><p>This tutorial will show you how to make a raspberry pi slot machine that pays out.</p>
<p>You will need:<br>-A Raspberry Pi<br>-A power supply for your Raspberry Pi<br>-An HDMI cable<br>-A monitor or TV<br>-A keyboard and mouse<br>-An SD card with Raspbian installed<br>-A joystick or controller (optional)<br>-Some coins for the slot machine<br>-A screwdriver<br>-Soldering iron (optional) </p>
<p> Step 1: assemble the parts To begin, you will need to assemble the parts for your Raspberry Pi slot machine. The first step is to attach the header pins to the RPi board. Next, add the SD card to the card reader on your computer. Finally, install the Raspbian operating system onto the SD card by following these instructions. Once you have finished, remove the SD card from your computer and insert it into your Raspberry Pi. Finally, connect the power supply to your Raspberry Pi and attach the HDMI cable to your monitor or TV.</p>
<p> Step 2: configure your raspberry pi Before you can start using your slot machine, you will need to configure your Raspberry Pi. This can be done by connecting a keyboard and mouse to your RPi and opening a terminal window. In the terminal window, type sudo raspi-config and hit enter. You will then be prompted to enter a password. The default password is raspberry. The raspi-config utility allows you to change various settings on your Raspberry Pi, including changing the password, selecting a locale and configuring Wi-Fi settings. You can also enable or disable various features of the RPi by running through the different options in this utility.</p>
<p> Step 3: install joydev driver Next, we will need to install a driver for our joystick or controller. This can be done by running the following command in a terminal window: sudo apt install joystick This will install the joystick driver on our Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p> Step 4: create slot machine script Now that our Raspberry Pi is configured and has all of its required drivers installed, we can start creating our slot machine script. First, create a new file called main.py in home directory of our RPi using nano or another text editor. In this file, we will write our Python code that controls our slot machine. We can start by importing some needed libraries: import os import random import time Next, we will create two global variables called num_coins and payout . num_coins defines how many coins are in our drawer of the slot machine, while payout defines what percentage of those coins should be paid out each time someone plays . We will keep payout at 5% for now: payout &#x3D; 0 . 05 Next, we need a function that randomly selects one of our coins from within num_coins : def chooseCoin ( num_coins ): return random . choice ( num_coins ) Now we need a function that determines whether or not we have won . This function takes two parameters: current_coin and payout . current_coin is simply a reference to one of our coins from within num_coins , while payout is the percentage of those coins that should be paid out if we win . def win ( current_coin , payout ): totalCoins &#x3D; 0 while totalCoins &lt;num_coins : if currentCoin &#x3D;&#x3D; chosenCoin (): totalCoins + &#x3D; 1 else : break payout + &#x3D; totalCoins return True Now we need a function that actually prints out our results : def printResults (): print ( “You have chosen coin number:” , chosenCoin ()) print ( “Your payout would be:” , payout ) print ( “” ) We’re almost ready to write our main() function, but first we need to define some constants that we’ll use later in our code: # these constants are drawn from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card#Chip_and_PIN">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card#Chip_and_PIN</a> MAX_COINS &#x3D; 10 # number of coins in drawer PAYOUT &#x3D; 100 # percentage of coins paid out as prize COINSIZE &#x3D; 16 # size (in mm) of each coin Now let’s write our main() function: def main(): globalnum_coins globalpayout os . system ( “clear” ) printResults () while True : currentCoin &#x3D; chooseCoin ( num_coins ) if win ( currentCoin , payload ): printResults () os . system ( “sudo reboot” ) else : printResults () time . sleep ( 3 ) main () Save this file and exit nano by pressing Ctrl+X followed by Y and ENTER keys respectively. We can now run this script on our Raspberry Pi by typing python3 main.py in a terminal window followed by ENTER key. If everything goes according as planned, you should see something similar to this output on your screen: You have chosen coin number 4 Your payoff would be 100</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-for-beginners"><a href="#How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-for-beginners" class="headerlink" title="How to make a raspberry pi slot machine for beginners"></a>How to make a raspberry pi slot machine for beginners</h1><p>This is a guide on how to create a raspberry pi slot machine. </p>
<p>You will need:<br>-A Raspberry Pi<br>-An SD card (at least 4GB)<br>-A power supply<br>-A keyboard<br>-A mouse<br>-A monitor </p>
<ul>
<li>HDMI cable </li>
<li>A USB keyboard or mouse (if your Raspberry Pi doesn’t have one built in) </li>
<li>Some coins&#x2F;slots&#x2F;buttons (doesn’t matter what you use as long as it can fit into the Raspberry Pi) </li>
<li>Tape<br>First, you will need to install Raspbian on your SD card. To do this, you can use NOOBS or BerryBoot. NOOBS is easier to use, but BerryBoot has more options. You can find instructions for both at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">www.raspberrypi.org</a>. Once Raspbian is installed, put the SD card in your Raspberry Pi and plug in the power supply. Connect the HDMI cable to your monitor and turn on the Raspberry Pi. It will start up and ask you to select a language. Choose your language and hit “OK”. The main screen will then appear. You will need to open a terminal window to continue with the next few steps. To do this, click on the icon that looks like a black square with a white cross in it at the top of the screen. This will open up the terminal window. In the terminal window, type “sudo apt-get update” without quotes and hit “ enter” . This will update all of the software on your Raspberry Pi. Then type “sudo apt-get upgrade” without quotes and hit “enter” . This will upgrade all of the software on your Raspberry Pi again. Now we can get started on making our slot machine! Type “sudo raspi-config” without quotes and hit “enter” . This will open up the configuration menu for your Raspberry Pi. Select “5 Interfacing Options” and then select “P1 Serial” . Change the settings so that it says 115200 8N1 under both “Baud Rate” and “Data Bits” . Select “OK” , then select “Finish” . This will close out of raspi-config . Next, we need to install WiringPi2 which we will use to control our buttons and slots. In the terminal window, type “git clone <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi2&quot;">https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi2&quot;</a> without quotes and hit “enter”. This will download wiringPi2 onto your raspberry pi. Then type “cd wiringPi2” without quotes and hit “enter” . This will change directory so that you are in the wiringPi2 folder downloaded earlier. Then type “.&#x2F;build” without quotes and hit “enter” . This will compile wiringPi2 for you so that it is ready to use. Now we can move onto setting up our slots! In the terminal window, type “gpio readall” without quotes and hit “enter”. This prints out all of the current GPIO pins that are available on your raspberry pi In order for us to use a pin for our slots, we first need to export it as an output pin using GPIO Zero library which we installed earlier with pip3 install gpiozero -U . We can then reference this pin number in our code later on when we are setting up our slots machine programatically.. Type “gpio export 18 out” without quotes and hit “enter”. This exports GPIO18 as an output pin which we can use for our slots machine Later on when we want to change the state of this output pin, we can simply type “gpio write 18 1” without quotes in order to turn it off or “gpio write 18 0” without quotes in order to turn it back on Again, these commands assume that you want to use GPIO18 as your slot machine Output Pin Number .. You can change this depending on which GPIO pin you would like to use for your slots machine..Now let’s move onto writing our code! For this project, I wrote all of my code in Python3 using Thonny IDE which is preinstalled with Raspbian Stretch.. If you are not familiar with Python3 programming language or Thonny IDE , I suggest checking out some tutorials online before proceeding With that said, let’s get started! First import all of the necessary libraries that we’ll be using.. import time import random import gpiozero import Adafruit_DHT as dht import socket Finally, let’s set up some global variables .. NUM_SLOTS &#x3D; 5 # Number of Slots machines WIRINGPI_GPIO_NUMBER &#x3D; 18 # GPIO Number corresponding with Output Pin used for Slots Machine CoinSlot &#x3D; 1 #</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-with-no-programming"><a href="#How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-with-no-programming" class="headerlink" title="How to make a raspberry pi slot machine with no programming"></a>How to make a raspberry pi slot machine with no programming</h1><p>This guide will show you how to make a raspberry pi slot machine with no programming required. You will need:</p>
<p>-Raspberry Pi<br>-Slot machine cabinet<br>-Laptop or computer to edit files<br>-SD card reader<br>-HDMI cable<br>-Mouse and keyboard<br>-Powered USB hub<br>-10 plus 1 buttons (for player 1)<br>-10 plus 1 buttons (for player 2)<br>-USB slot for power supply<br>-Wire strippers<br>-Screwdriver<br>-Soldering iron<br>-Solder<br>-Drill<br>-7&#x2F;32 inch drill bit<br>-1&#x2F;8 inch drill bit </p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Disassemble the slot machine cabinet. There are usually screws on the underside that need to be removed. Once the cabinet is open, unscrew the mechanism that holds the coins in place and remove it. This mechanism usually consists of a metal arm and spring. Note where each piece goes so it can be put back together later. In addition, remove the glass front panel of the cabinet and set it aside. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Drill two holes in the top of the cabinet using a 7&#x2F;32 inch drill bit. Make sure they are in line with each other and are large enough to fit the buttons through. Drill two more holes in the same spot using a 1&#x2F;8 inch drill bit. These will be used for the LED lights later on. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Cut a piece of wood to fit inside the cabinet using a saw. This will be used to mount the Raspberry Pi later on. Make sure it is big enough to fit comfortably inside and has space for the buttons and LED lights to be mounted too. Sand down any rough edges with sandpaper until it is smooth. Mount this piece of wood inside the cabinet using screws or adhesive pads.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4A . If you are using an older Raspberry Pi model (e..g B+, A+, etc), then before proceeding any further you will need to solder headers onto your Raspberry Pi as shown in this tutorial: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/pinout/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/pinout/</a>. If you are using a newer model (e..g 3B+), then skip this step as headers are already included on the board). Once you have soldered on the headers, align your Raspberry Pi over top of the piece of wood that was mounted inside the cabinet earlier, making sure all of the header pins go through their corresponding holes, then screw it into place using 2x6mm screws . If you’re not comfortable soldering or don’t have a soldering iron, you can use a USB adapter instead which can be purchased from most electronic stores .</p>
<p>5 . Plug your HDMI cable into your Raspberry Pi and attach it to your TV or monitor . Plug in your mouse, keyboard and power supply into their respective USB slots . Your Raspberry Pi is now ready for setup .</p>
<p>6 . Navigate to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/images/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/images/</a> raspbian -stretch -liteand download “ raspbian -stretch -lite” onto your SD card using an SD card reader . Once downloaded, unzip file and drag “boot” , “configs” &amp; “filesystem” folders onto your SD card . Safely eject SD card from computer and insert into Raspberry Pi . Turn on your Raspberry Pi by pressing down on power switch located at bottom left corner of board until lit up star icon is seen , then wait for Raspbian desktop screen to appear . We recommend writing down your raspberry pi username ( pi ) and password ( raspberry ) somewhere safe just in case you forget them !</p>
<p>7 . Now we need to install some required software onto our raspberry pi which we can do by opening up terminal command prompt window and typing : sudo apt - get install python3 - pip git weather - icons When prompted , type y if you agree to terms or n if you don’t . Also note that these commands might take some time to complete so please be patient ! After installation has completed , type exitand hit enter key which will close out terminal window . </p>
<p>8A . If you want to use your raspberry pi as a media server , then we need install Kodi software which we can do by opening up terminal command prompt window again and typing : sudo apt - get install kodi kodi - Addons - repository pvr When prompted , type y if you agree to terms or n if you don’t – Kodi installation may take few minutes so please be patient ! After installation has completed , type exitand hit enter key once again which will close out terminal window leaving us back at our Raspbian desktop screen once again ! Now we just have add some customizations before we can begin</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-with-Python"><a href="#How-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-slot-machine-with-Python" class="headerlink" title="How to make a raspberry pi slot machine with Python"></a>How to make a raspberry pi slot machine with Python</h1><p>This article will show you how to make a raspberry pi slot machine with Python. You will need:</p>
<p>-Raspberry Pi 3<br>-Micro SD card (8GB or more)</p>
<ul>
<li>powerswitch Tail II<br>-HDMI cable<br>-Keyboard<br>-Mouse<br>-Monitor<br>-5V 2A power supply<br>-Three slot machines (these can be acquired on eBay, Amazon, etc.)<br>-USB keyboard and mouse for the Raspberry Pi<br>-wire strippers<br>-electrical tape<br>-soldering iron<br>-solder<br>-(optional) Hot glue gun with glue sticks<br>-(optional) Schrödinger’s Cat Figurine</li>
</ul>
<p>… ## Step 1: Assemble the hardware components The first step is to assemble the hardware components. This includes the Raspberry Pi 3, micro SD card, powerswitch Tail II, HDMI cable, keyboard, mouse, and monitor. For instructions on how to do this, please consult the Raspberry Pi Foundation website: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/hardware/raspberrypi.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/hardware/raspberrypi.md</a>. Additionally, you will need three slot machines for this project. ## Step 2: Connect the hardware components Next, you will need to connect the hardware components. This includes connecting the Raspberry Pi 3 to the monitor via HDMI, connecting the keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi 3via USB, and connecting the power supply to the Raspberry Pi 3 and powerswitch Tail II. For detailed instructions on how to do this, please consult the Raspberry Pi Foundation website: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/configuration-overview.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/configuration-overview.md</a>. Please note that for this project you will need to solder two wires from the power switch Tail II to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi 3 (pin numbers 6 and 8). You will also need to solder two wires from each of the slot machines to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi 3 (pin numbers 17, 18, 27, and 28). If you are not comfortable using a soldering iron, you can alternatively use a hot glue gun to attach these wires. However, if you choose to use a hot glue gun please be sure that it is out of reach of children and that you are using caution when handling it as it can be dangerous. ## Step 3: Install software Next you will need to install software onto your RaspberryPi3 . This includes installing Raspbian OS , Python , and wiringPi . To install Raspbian OS , please consult these instructions from raspberrypi.org: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md</a>. Once Raspbian OS is installed, you will need to install Python . To do this, open up a terminal window and enter these commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 -y Once Python is installed, you will need to install wiringPi . To do this type in this command into your terminal window: git clone <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gitlab.com/gbaman/wiringPi">https://gitlab.com/gbaman/wiringPi</a> cd wiringPi .&#x2F;build After wiringPi is installed successfullyyou should now have a folder called “wiringPi” in your home directory. Inside this folder there should be a file called “build”. To run this file type in this command into your terminal window: sudo .&#x2F;build This will compile and install wiringPi onto your raspberry pi3 . ## Step 4: Write Python code Now that all of the software has been installed you can start writing code for your project! The first thing we are going to do is import all ofthe necessary libraries into our script file. To do this open up a text editor such as nano or vimand create a new file called “slots_machine .py” Then enter in these lines of code : import RPi . GPIO as GPIO import time import random def power_on ( pin ): print ( “Powering on” ) GPIO . output ( pin , GPIO . HIGH ) time . sleep ( 1 ) def power_off ( pin ): print ( “Powering off” ) GPIO . output ( pin , GPIO . LOW ) time . sleep ( 1 ) def spin_slot_machines (): while True : print ( “Spinning slots machines” ) for i in range ( 0 , 3 ): try : GPIO . output ( 17 + i , GPIO . HIGH ) time . sleep ( 0 . 5 ) GPIO . output ( 17 + i , GPIO . LOW ) except KeyboardInterrupt : break def stop_slot_machines (): for i in range ( 0 , 3 ): try : GPIO . output ( 17 + i , GPIO . HIGH ) time . sleep (. 5 ) GPIO . output ( 17 + i , GPIO . LOW ) except KeyboardInterrupt : break</p>
