#  Illinois Amends Gaming Law to Allow Wagering Machines

On Wednesday, the Illinois Senate voted to amend the state's gaming law to include wagering machines. Amended Bill SB1849 now goes back to the House for final approval before being sent to Governor J.B. Pritzker to be signed into law.

The amended bill allows licensed establishments, such as bars and truck stops, to offer up to five video gambling machines. The maximum bet per machine is $2, with a limit of $10 per player per day. Establishments must also dedicate at least 40% of their profits from machine wagering to charity.

Supporters of the amendment argue that it will provide much-needed revenue to struggling communities and charities. "We know that this is a form of gaming that people want," said State Senator Terry Link (D-Lake County). "It will help generate revenues in areas where they are sorely needed."

Opponents of the amendment argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and social ills. "This is going to create more addicts, more broken marriages, more problems in our society," said State Senator Dave Syverson (R-Rockford). "It's going to be a disaster."

Governor Pritzker has not yet indicated whether he will sign the amended bill into law.

#  Illinois Moving Forward with Plans to License Wagering Machines

A recent report from the Illinois Gaming Board has recommended that the state move forward with a plan to license wagering machines in bars and taverns. The recommendation is in response to a increasing demand for such machines, which are currently being used illegally in many establishments.

The proposed licensing would allow for up to 5,000 machines to be placed in establishments across Illinois. The Board estimates that the licensing would generate over $60 million in revenue annually, which would be used to fund programs for problem gambling addiction.

Opponents of the proposal argue that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates. However, supporters assert that the licensing will bring much needed revenue to the state while also providing responsible regulation of the machines.

#  Illinois Extends Deadline for Applications for Wagering Machines Licenses

The Illinois Gaming Board has announced that it is extending the deadline for receiving applications for licenses to operate wagering machines. The previous deadline was October 1, and the new deadline is November 1.

This extension provides more time for interested parties to submit their applications and allows the Illinois Gaming Board additional time to review the submissions. The board has not yet announced when it will award the licenses.

# Background on Wagering Machine Licensing in Illinois

In May 2017, the Illinois Gaming Board issued a request for proposal (RFP) for licenses to operate wagering machines. The proposal outlined the licensing requirements and gave interested parties until October 1, 2017 to submit their applications.

The licensing requirements include a minimum capital investment of $2 million, background checks for all key personnel, and compliance with local zoning regulations. The licenses are valid for five years and can be renewed.

# Why Is Illinois Issuing Licenses for Wagering Machines?

#  Illinois Issues First Wave of Licenses for Wagering Machines

The state of Illinois has issued the first wave of licenses for wagering machines, which will be made available at horse racing tracks throughout the state. The licenses were issued to 10 companies, who will now have the ability to operate the machines at the various race tracks.

The issuance of licenses comes as good news for those in the gambling industry, as it provides a new way to generate revenue. It is also expected to create new jobs in the area. In addition, the machines are anticipated to draw more people to the tracks, which should help to boost attendance and betting totals.
