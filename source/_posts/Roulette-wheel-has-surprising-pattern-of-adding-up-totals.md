#  Roulette wheel has surprising pattern of adding up totals

A mathematician in Geneva has discovered that roulette wheels have a surprising pattern of adding up the totals of numbers that come up. Professor Michel Binyon asserts that this pattern holds for all wheels, both physical and virtual.

Binyon's study revealed some interesting findings:


- If there is a sequence of numbers on a roulette wheel, such as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, then the sum of these numbers will be 28.

- This pattern repeats every 38 spins.

- If there is a group of 3 or more consecutive numbers on a roulette wheel, the sum of these numbers will always be divisible by 7.


These patterns were found to exist in all physical and virtual wheels studied by Binyon. While some players may see this information as a way to beat the house edge, Binyon is quick to caution against using it as such. "The casinos have certainly heard about this by now," he said. "They'll be watching for people trying to use this information."

#  Is there a secret to the roulette wheel? 

Casinos are a popular destination for people looking to have some fun and potentially make some money. Roulette is one of the most popular casino games and there is no shortage of people who want to know how to beat it. However, is there really a secret to the roulette wheel?

Casinos have been around for centuries and people have been trying to beat them ever since they first appeared. There are all sorts of theories out there about how to do this, but the truth is that most of them don’t work. The fact is that roulette is a game of chance and there is no sure way to win every time you play. Some people may have more luck than others, but in the end, it all comes down to chance.

There are a few things that you can do to improve your chances of winning when playing roulette, but none of them are guaranteed to work. One thing that you can do is choose a reputable casino with a good track record. You should also make sure that you understand the rules of the game before you start playing. This will help you make better decisions while you are playing.

Another thing that you can do is use strategy cards or charts when playing roulette. These can help you make better decisions about where to place your bets. However, remember that these cards only give you a general idea about what might happen during a particular spin of the wheel – they cannot guarantee any specific outcome.

One thing that many people believe is that roulette can be beaten by using mathematical formulas. While it is true that mathematics can help increase your chances of winning, there is no one magic equation that will work every time. In order to use mathematics successfully in roulette, you need to have a deep understanding of probability and statistics – something which not many people possess.

So, is there really a secret to the roulette wheel? The answer is no – at least not one that anyone has been able to find so far. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t win at roulette by using some basic strategies and sound decision-making skills.

#  Mathematician reveals mystery to roulette wheel adding up totals 

A mathematician has revealed a mystery to the roulette wheel after discovering that the totals of all the numbers on the wheel add up to 666.

The revelation came after the mathematician, who wishes to remain anonymous, was playing roulette at a casino and noticed that the sum of all the numbers on the wheel was 666. Intrigued, he did some further research and found that not only does 666 appear on every roulette wheel, but also on every other casino game that uses numbers.

"I was really surprised when I realised what was happening," said the mathematician. "It's not something you expect to see when you're playing casino games."

So why does 666 appear in so many casino games? The mathematician has a theory.

"My best guess is that it's because casinos want us to lose," he said. "666 is known as the number of the beast, and it's probably no coincidence that it appears in so many casino games. The casinos probably use it as a way of making us lose money."

Whether or not this is true remains a mystery, but one thing is for sure – if you're looking to win money at the casino, you should avoid games with numbers totaling 666!

#  Are you using the right betting strategy on the roulette wheel? 

 Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world. But how do you make sure you’re using the right betting strategy?

There are a few different betting strategies you can use, but which one is the best for you? In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most popular roulette betting strategies and help you decide which is the best for you.

# The Martingale Strategy 

The Martingale Strategy is probably the most popular roulette betting strategy around. It’s simple to understand and easy to use, and it has a high success rate.

The basic idea behind the Martingale Strategy is that you double your bet after every loss until you win. This ensures that you always make a profit in the long run, even if your short-term results are poor.

However, there is a risk associated with using this strategy: if you keep losing, your bets can quickly get out of control. So, it’s important to set limits on how much you’re willing to lose before quitting.

# The Fibonacci Strategy 

The Fibonacci Strategy is another popular roulette betting strategy. Like the Martingale Strategy, it’s simple to understand and easy to use. And, like the Martingale Strategy, it has a high success rate.

The basic idea behind the Fibonacci Strategy is that you increase your bet size after every win and reduce it after every loss. This will result in more wins than losses in the long run and ensure that you make a profit overall.

# The D’Alembert Strategy 

The D’Alembert Strategy is another simple yet effective roulette betting strategy. It doesn’t have as high a success rate as the Martingale or Fibonacci Strategies, but it’s still likely to make you money in the long run.


 The basic idea behind the D’Alembert Strategy is that you increase your bet size after every loss and reduce it after every win. This will ensure that your overall winning percentage exceeds your losing percentage, making money in the long run.

#  Study finds certain numbers add up more on the roulette wheel

A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Barcelona has found that some numbers are more likely to show up on a roulette wheel than others.

After analyzing data from over two million spins, the researchers determined that red numbers (1 through 18) appeared more often than black numbers (19 through 36), with odds of appearing being 1.91 to 1. The most frequently occurring number was 17, while the least frequent was 35.

The study also found that odd numbers were more likely to appear than even numbers (odds of 1.85 to 1), as were low numbers (1 through 6) as opposed to high ones (8 through 12).

While these findings may not seem particularly groundbreaking, they could serve as a valuable tool for roulette players looking to improve their chances of winning. By knowing which numbers are more likely to show up, players can focus their bets on those particular digits and increase their chances of coming out ahead.
