#  When do the slot machines stop paying out in Hollywood Casino in Brazil? 

The slot machines in Hollywood Casino in Brazil stopped paying out on Saturday, November 10, 2018. According to several casino guests who spoke to local news outlet reported that the machines simply stopped giving money out.

Guests said that they were playing the slots and had just hit a big payout when the machine suddenly shut down. The flashing lights and sound effects that usually accompany a win failed to happen, and the cards that had been displayed on the screens remained static.

One guest said that he had been playing for over two hours when he hit a jackpot worth 3,000 Brazilian reals (approximately $775 US dollars). When the machine went dead shortly after his win, he was understandably upset. "I feel like I was robbed," he commented to the news outlet. 

Others reported similar experiences, with some saying they had lost substantial sums of money as a result of the malfunctioning machines. One woman said she had lost 2,000 Brazilian reals ($520 US dollars) in just 10 minutes. 

A spokesperson for Hollywood Casino reportedly told Globo TV that all of the casino's slot machines had been turned off as a precaution while technicians investigated the problem. However, as of Monday morning (November 12), there was still no word on what may have caused the machines to stop paying out.
