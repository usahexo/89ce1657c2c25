#  Nets Drop 2nd Straight To Struggling Mets

The Brooklyn Nets were hoping for a different result in their second matchup against the New York Mets, but they once again lost by a score of 111-95.

This time around, it was the Mets who had the hot hand, shooting 50 percent from the field and 45 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, the Nets shot just 41 percent overall and made only six three-pointers.

Brooklyn's defense was also gashed by the Mets, who racked up 63 points in the paint. Meanwhile, the Nets could only muster 36 points in the paint themselves.

Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson was clearly disappointed with his team's performance:
"They just played better than us," Atkinson said after the game. "They were more physical, they executed better."

The Nets now find themselves with a 4-10 record on the season and will look to get back on track when they take on the Detroit Pistons later this week.

#  Why Won't The Mets Win In Their Own Stadium?

The Mets have not had very much success at Citi Field. The Mets are a team that should be able to win in their own ballpark, but they have not been able to do that. Their home record is significantly worse than their road record.

There are a few factors that have contributed to this. One is the fact that the Mets' bullpen has not been very good. The bullpen has blown a number of games at home, which has led to the Mets losing those games.

Another factor is the fact that the Mets have not been able to score many runs at home. This has been due in part to the fact that they have had trouble hitting home runs at home. They have only hit 23 homers at Citi Field this season, compared to 47 homers on the road.

The Mets have also had trouble with defense at home. They have made a number of costly errors, which has led to them losing games they should have won.

The Mets will need to address these issues if they hope to win more games at Citi Field. The good news is that there is still time for them to do so. They still have some time left in the season to improve their play at home and make a run for the playoffs.

#  Conforto, Frazier Homer Again As Mets Stay Alive

In a matchup that pitted young starters against one another in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, it was the Mets hitters who stole the show. Michael Conforto and Todd Frazier went yard off Gerrit Cole to give their team a 3-0 lead after three innings, and they would never look back, cruising to an 8-1 victory to stay alive in the series.

It was clear early on that the Mets were going to take advantage of Cole’s mistakes; both Conforto and Frazier were able to drive the ball out of the park after getting good pitches to hit. Frazier’s home run was especially timely, coming as it did after the Astros had scored their only run of the game in the top of the inning.

The rest of the Mets lineup also contributed, with eight different players recording at least one hit. Jay Bruce and Yoenis Cespedes each drove in two runs, and Austin Jackson added a triple to his postseason resume.

The win keeps the Mets’ season alive for at least one more day; they will now head to Houston for Game 5 with their backs against the wall. If they can manage to win that game, they will move on to face either the Dodgers or Braves in the NL Championship Series.

#  5 Reasons Why Mets Fans Are Disappointed In This Season

The New York Mets are one of the most iconic franchises in all of sports. The team has a rich history, filled with both highs and lows. However, the past few seasons have been a disappointment for the Mets’ fans. This season is no different, as the Mets sit in last place in the National League East with a record of 36-48. So, what are the reasons why Mets fans are disappointed in this season?

1) Injuries

One of the main reasons for the Mets’ disappointing season is injuries. The team has been ravaged by injuries this season, with key players such as Matt Harvey, Lucas Duda, and Neil Walker missing significant time. This has led to inconsistency on the field, as the Mets have had trouble finding a consistent lineup.

2) Poor Play

In addition to injuries, the Mets have also been plagued by poor play this season. The team ranks near the bottom of the league in most offensive categories, and their pitching staff has been inconsistent as well. This has resulted in a number of blowout losses, which has left fans frustrated.

3) Lack of Star Power

Another reason why fans are disappointed this season is because the Mets lack star power. Unlike teams such as the Yankees or Dodgers, who have several superstar players, the Mets don’t have any stand-out players. As a result, they often struggle to score runs and win games.

4) Disappointing Season After Season

Fans are also disappointed because it seems like the Mets always have a disappointing season. They haven’t made playoffs since 2006 and they haven’t won a World Series since 1986. This year’s poor play simply adds to that frustration.

5) Negative Media Coverage

Lastly, one of the main reasons why fans are disappointed this season is because of all the negative media coverage the team has received. From Sandy Alderson trade rumors to reports of infighting within the team, there has been plenty for fans to be concerned about this season.

#  Can The Mets Salvage A Postseason Berth?

The Mets (69-61) have officially been eliminated from playoff contention, per Anthony DiComo of MLB.com.

This news is devastating to a team that entered the season with high hopes of winning their first NL pennant since 2000. The Mets were crippled by injuries early in the season and never recovered, despite assembling a talented roster led by Yoenis Cespedes, Jacob deGrom, and Noah Syndergaard.

So now that their playoff hopes are gone, what's next for the Mets?

One option for the Mets is to trade some of their valuable assets before the August 31 waiver trade deadline. Cespedes, who is owed $29 million in 2018-2019, could be attractive to many teams looking for a power bat. deGrom and Syndergaard are also possible trade targets, as both are under team control for several more years.

If the Mets decide to stick with their current roster, they could still make a strong playoff run. The team is only 3 games back of the Milwaukee Brewers for the second wild card spot in the National League.

It will be interesting to see what direction the Mets choose to go in over the next few weeks. With an exciting young core and plenty of financial flexibility, they could go either way.
