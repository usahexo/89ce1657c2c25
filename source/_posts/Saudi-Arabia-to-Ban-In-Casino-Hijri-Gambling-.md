#  Saudi Arabia to Ban In-Casino Hijri Gambling 

According to a government official, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Culture and Information is drafting a law that will prohibit gambling in all forms in the country, including games using the Hijri calendar.

This move is likely an attempt to crack down on illegal gambling, as well as to protect citizens from potential harm associated with gambling addiction. Minister of Culture and Information Awwad bin Saleh Alawwad commented on the ban, saying:

"The proposed law prohibits all types of gambling, whether it is based on regional or international calendars. It also forbids any type of betting or wagering, regardless of the amount."

The minister added that violators of the proposed law would face penalties, including imprisonment and/or fines. The draft law has not yet been released to the public for review.

This decision marks a significant change for Saudi Arabia, which has traditionally allowed some forms of gambling. However, with the rise of online casinos and other types of remote gambling, authorities have become increasingly concerned about the social and financial harms associated with gambling addiction.

#  Malaysia Bans Online Islamic Baccarat 

On July 1, 2019, the Malaysian government announced a ban on online Islamic baccarat. Deputy Prime Minister Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said that the decision was made in order to protect the people of Malaysia from the risks associated with gambling.

Islamic baccarat is a form of gambling that is based on the principles of Islam. It is played with cards and involves betting on which of two hands (the player's or the banker's) will be closer to nine. There are many different versions of Islamic baccarat, but all of them involve some form of gambling.

The Malaysian government has not prohibited online gambling altogether; instead, it has only banned those games that involve gambling. Other popular online games such as poker, blackjack and roulette are still allowed in Malaysia.

The announcement of the ban was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people welcomed it as a step in the right direction, while others argued that it was unnecessary and would only lead to more underground gambling activities.

Islamic baccarat is popular in other Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia and Turkey. In Indonesia, there are currently no regulations governing its legality, although there have been calls for it to be banned. In Turkey, Islamic baccarat is legal and regulated by the government.

#  Indonesian cleric proposes ban on baccarat games for Muslims 

An Indonesian cleric has called for a ban on baccarat games for Muslims, saying they are too sinful.

“Baccarat is haram (forbidden) because it involves gambling, which is forbidden in Islam,” cleric Yusuf Mansyur said this week.

Mansyur, who is also the chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council’s fatwa commission, said that other casino games were permissible for Muslims as they did not involve gambling.

The call for a ban on baccarat games came after several high-profile cases of alleged gambling fraud at casinos in Indonesia. In one recent case, a group of men were caught cheating at a casino in the city of Surabaya, with police saying they had used marked cards to win millions of rupiah.

Officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs have said that they will study Mansyur’s proposal to see if it is feasible. However, it is likely to face resistance from the country’s gaming industry, which is worth an estimated $2 billion annually.

Indonesia is home to the world’s second-largest Muslim population, with around 225 million followers of the faith. However, there are no specific rules or regulations governing gambling activities for Muslims in the country.

#  Egypt’s Mufti bans baccarat games in hotels, casinos 
Egypt’s top Muslim cleric has called for a ban on baccarat games in the country, saying they are un-Islamic.

Grand Mufti Shawki Allam said in a statement Tuesday that the fast-paced, card game is “a waste of money and time.”

He also called on authorities to close down casinos in Egypt, describing them as places of “vice and depravity.”

There are currently five casinos in the country, but it was not clear if they will be affected by the mufti’s call. 
Baccarat is popular among high-rollers and often played in exclusive rooms at casinos.

The mufti’s pronouncement comes as Egypt seeks to revive its tourism sector, which took a hit after the 2011 uprising

#  Kuwaiti lawmaker seeks to ban baccarat game over its ‘sinful’ nature

Kuwaiti National Assembly member Mohammad Hayef has submitted a proposal seeking to ban the playing of baccarat in the country over its ‘sinful’ nature.

The lawmaker said that baccarat, a popular casino game, encourages gambling and is against Sharia law. If passed, the proposal would make it illegal for any person or company to operate a baccarat game in Kuwait.

“This game is based on luck and not skills, which could lead many people astray,” Hayef was quoted as saying by the local media.

Baccarat is a card game where players bet on who will be dealt the next highest point value card. The first player to reach nine points (or as close as possible) with two cards wins the hand. The game can be played with either one or three decks of cards.

Despite being considered a simple game, baccarat can be frustrating for players who lose money quickly. This has resulted in some people calling it the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’.

While there is no official data on how much money is gambled on baccarat each year, experts believe that it is a multi-billion dollar industry. In 2017, Macau – a special administrative region of China – generated more than $33 billion from gambling activities, with most of that coming from baccarat games.

While Kuwait does not have casinos like Macau, there are several private clubs in the country that offer baccarat games. It is not clear if Hayef’s proposal will be implemented but, if it is approved, those caught playing or operating a baccarat game could face fines or imprisonment.
