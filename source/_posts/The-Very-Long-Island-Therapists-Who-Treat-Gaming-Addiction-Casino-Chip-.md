#  Newly Identified Disorder: Therapists on LI Treat Gaming Addiction Casino Chip 

A new study published in the journal "Addictive Behaviors" has identified a previously unrecognized disorder: gaming addiction. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at Stony Brook University, found that a significant number of people who regularly play video games may be addicted to them.

The researchers surveyed nearly 1,500 gamers and found that 9% of them met the criteria for gaming addiction. This means that they were unable to control their gaming habits, were preoccupied with thoughts of gaming, and exhibited withdrawal symptoms when they weren't able to game.

Participants who met the criteria for addiction reported playing an average of 33 hours per week. They also said that they felt irritable and restless when they weren't playing video games and had problems completing daily tasks due to their gaming habits.

Dr. Jason academician at SUNY says these results are alarming and indicative of a real problem that needs to be addressed. "It's not just a problem with children anymore," he says. "It's now something that's affecting adults as well."

The study's authors say that more research is needed to determine whether or not gaming addiction should be classified as its own disorder. In the meantime, they advise people who think they may be addicted to gaming to seek out professional help.

#  FromCasino Chips to Soap operas: How One Woman's Path to Recovery Led Her Everywhere

Growing up, Jane always loved going to the casino with her dad. She would watch in fascination as he placed his bets and she was always so excited when she would get to go home with a small bag of brightly colored chips. As she got older, Jane started to experiment with gambling on her own and before long, she was hooked. She loved the thrill of risking it all and watching the numbers on the screen change.

Jane's gambling addiction quickly spiraled out of control and before long, she was spending all her money on casino games. She stopped paying rent and started borrowing money from friends and family members. She even maxed out her credit cards trying to chase her losses. Jane was in total denial about her addiction and refused to seek help.

As her debts mounted, Jane's life started to unravel. Her relationships with friends and family deteriorated and she became more and more isolated. She stopped going to work and spent all day everyday in front of the slot machines or at the roulette table. Her health began to suffer as well and she started to lose weight because she couldn't bring herself to eat.

Suddenly, one day, Jane hit rock bottom. She realized that she had lost everything--her job, her home, her money, and most importantly, her dignity. She finally decided to seek help for her gambling addiction and entered into a rehab program.

It was a difficult journey but with the support of her rehab counselors and fellow patients, Jane finally got the help she needed. After completing the program, she started working on rebuilding her life one step at a time. She got a new job, moved into a new apartment, and slowly started to pay back her debts.

Jane is now 5 years sober and is happily married with two children. She credits her recovery not only to rehab but also to Al-Anon, a 12-step program for families of alcoholics. Without the support of both programs, Jane doesn't think she would be alive today. She is living proof that no matter how bad things seem at first, there is always hope for a better future.
